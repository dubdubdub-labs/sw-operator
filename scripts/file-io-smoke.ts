 * File IO Smoke (temporary)

 * Goal: validate remote file write/read semantics (text, JSON, binary) and permissions
 * using the providerâ€™s file operations. Ensures correctness before wiring deeper flows.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/file-io-smoke.ts
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This is a stub. Fill in once provider + exec runner exist.
