# Progress Log (Append-Only)

This is an append-only implementation log. Do not edit previous entries; always append new entries at the end with a timestamp. Keep entries dense and precise.

Entry format
- Summary: 1â€“2 lines
- Done: short bullets
- Next: short bullets
- Decisions: short bullets (what we locked in)
- Issues/Risks: short bullets
- Notes/Links: short bullets (paths, refs)

<!-- Log cleared after migration to CodeSandbox and shared Vitest config. Append new entries below. -->
